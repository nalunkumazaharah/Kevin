    <p>These are my bad experiences I first experienced at AkiraChix.</p>
    <ol>
    
            <li>The area is sorrounded with very many trees which makes it too cold all the time.</li>
            <li>Being served dishes that have never tasted before which gave me a bad time to eat.</li>
            <li>Being away from my people and not being allowed to take a visit to them.</li>
        </ol>
